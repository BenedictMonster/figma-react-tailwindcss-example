# Figma React Tailwindcss Example

## Development Guide

### Pre-requisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) â€“ v18
- [Figma desktop app](https://figma.com/downloads/)

### Build the plugin

```
$ yarn install
```

To build the plugin:

```
$ yarn run build
```

This will generate a `build/` directory containing the JavaScript bundle(s) for the plugin.

To watch for code changes and rebuild the plugin automatically:

```
$ yarn run watch
```

If a plugin doesn't reload itself on Figma, press `command + option + p` to re-run the last plugin.

Upgrade packages

```
npm install -g syncyarnlock
yarn upgrade --latest
syncyarnlock -s -k
```

### Install the plugin

1. In the Figma desktop app, open a Figma document.
2. Search for and run `Import plugin from manifestâ€¦` via the Quick Actions search bar.
3. Select the `manifest.json` file.

### Debugging

Use `console.log` statements to inspect values in your code.

To open the developer console, search for and run `Open Console` via the Quick Actions search bar.
